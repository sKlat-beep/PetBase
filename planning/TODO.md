# PetBase Task Board

Authoritative task list — open tasks only, organized by phase.
Use `/intake` skill to add new tasks (place under the appropriate phase header).

> **On task completion — follow this exact sequence:**
> 1. Log a COMPLETE entry in `planning/dev-log.md` (today's session journal)
> 2. Remove the task from this file
> 3. Archive to `planning/archive/dev-log-completed.md` happens during next-day rotation ONLY
> **Never skip step 1. Never archive directly.**

> **Token efficiency:** When referencing this file, read only the phase section
> relevant to your current work — do not read the entire file.
